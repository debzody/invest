DEPRECATED - The Upstox Python SDK is in its end-of-life stage and has been deprecated. We strongly encourage you to transition to the updated package, upstox-python-sdk. This can be installed via pip install upstox-python-sdk (find further details at https://pypi.org/project/upstox-python-sdk/). The new package ensures full compatibility with Upstox API v2.0, as well as subsequent versions, and will receive ongoing updates and support.
